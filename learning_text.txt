Now on the stage, when i just created index.js file and models in the /models floder -
i need to create relationships between models:

We can create relationships with Sequelize, as well as with the use of associations.

To create relationships:

One-to-one – We need to specify which model belongs to another by using the model2.belongsTo(model1) function in one and model1.hasOne(model2) in another.

One-to-many – We need to specify which model belongs to another by using the model2.belongsTo(model1) function in one and model1.hasMany(model2) in another.

Many-to-many – We need to use model1.belongsToMany (model2, {through: {model3}}), in SQL analogy, model3 will store keys of model1 and model2 in columns.


*** ___From Sequelize documentation - Associations___***

Sequelize supports the standard associations: One-To-One, One-To-Many and Many-To-Many.

To do this, Sequelize provides four types of associations that should be combined to create them:

The HasOne association
The BelongsTo association
The HasMany association
The BelongsToMany association

Syntax: 

const A = sequelize.define('A' /* ... */);
const B = sequelize.define('B' /* ... */);

A.hasOne(B); // A HasOne B
A.belongsTo(B); // A BelongsTo B
A.hasMany(B); // A HasMany B
A.belongsToMany(B, { through: 'C' }); // A BelongsToMany B through the junction table C


----After writing a associations for my models - We need to invoke these associating functions after the initialisation of our models.
For tat i add code in index.js in the ‘models’ folder before returning the db object:
Object.keys(db).forEach(modelName => {
  if (db[modelName].associate) {
    db[modelName].associate(db);
  }
});
